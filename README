The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use in ~ssdavis/60/p5.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your train.cpp source code.
testhw will copy from the Testing directory the TrainRunner.*, and CPUTimer.h files.
It then compiles your program using your Makefile, and runs it with the three 
st-20000-8000-*.txt files as its command line parameter.  
The results are placed in the results.txt file in the directory with the source code in it.
